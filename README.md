# What's in _here_?
* [Proppian Narrateme Story Generators](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/NaNoGenMo2014/tree/master/propp.gen)

* My [2013 work](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/NaNoGenMo.yawp/) - contains lots of dead-end code + notes.


# What's a novel?
For the purposes of this project, a novel is ~= 50,000 words.


# Sustaining Interest/Readability
It's possible to output "Hello World" 25,000 times and fulfill the bargain.

But it'll be damned boring.

How to sustain interest over that length of generated text?

One tack is to take an existing novel and modify it. Woo hoo!

Another, that I'm pursising, is to build lots and lots of small, somewhat-interesting fragments, and collect them together.
Technically, that's a collection of short-stories, I suppose.
So, call them chapters? [cheap trick]

Darius K. has done "Generative dialogue" by pulling lots/most (all?) of it from Twitter. This "makes it real" and keeps interest moving.
