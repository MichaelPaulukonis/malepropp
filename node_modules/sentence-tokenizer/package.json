Possibly composed of several sentences.\");\n\nGet the sentences:\n\n    console.log(tokenizer.getSentences());\n\nWhich should produce:\n\n    [ 'This is an entry.',\n      'Possibly composed of several sentences.' ]\n\nIf you want word-level tokens, use:\n\n    console.log(tokenizer.getTokens());\n\nYielding:\n\n    [ 'This',\n      'is',\n      'an',\n      'entry.' ]\n\nTo get the second sentence, use:\n\n    console.log(tokenizer.getTokens(1));\n\n## Also\n\n* [https://github.com/chrisumbel/natural](https://github.com/chrisumbel/natural)\n* [https://github.com/Floby/node-tokenizer](https://github.com/Floby/node-tokenizer)\n\n## License\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright 2012 François Parmentier.
