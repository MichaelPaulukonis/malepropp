# Sentence Tokenizer
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/parmentf/node-sentence-tokenizer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/parmentf/node-sentence-tokenizer)

Tokenize paragraphs into sentences, and smaller tokens.

## Installation

Use [npm](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install sentence-tokenizer


## How to

Require the module:

    var Tokenizer = require('sentence-tokenizer');

Instanciate a tokenizer, with the name of the utterer:

    var tokenizer = new Tokenizer('Chuck');

Set the entry to work on:

    tokenizer.setEntry("This is an entry. Possibly composed of several sentences.");

Get the sentences:

    console.log(tokenizer.getSentences());

Which should produce:

    [ 'This is an entry.',
      'Possibly composed of several sentences.' ]

If you want word-level tokens, use:

    console.log(tokenizer.getTokens());

Yielding:

    [ 'This',
      'is',
      'an',
      'entry.' ]

To get the second sentence, use:

    console.log(tokenizer.getTokens(1));
